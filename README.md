# converyor-belt-simulation
A python script to simulate a conveyor belt that leverages PyBullet for physics simulation and PySimpleGUI for GUI. 
You can import URDF as object to be moved on the conveyor belt or you can convert STL files to URDF and then use them. 
There are several option that can be changed such as: quantity of objects to be moved, time between objects generations, starting point, conveyor scaling, speed, bounciness, friction, damping and objects weight.
